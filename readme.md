# Clones

> Repos I cloned

I have macro that will take current browser tab and clone it into `~/clones` with `author--name` naming (note the `--`). I can then instantly know if the repo I have opened in Cursor is a clone or not.

Forks have `---` and are put in [~/forks](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/forks). With automations to do contributions fast.
